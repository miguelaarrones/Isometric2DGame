# Isometric2DGame
A demo game made as a techincal test for [RunicDices](https://runicdices.io)

This game was made in 5 days using Unity version 2022.3.44f1 with the 2D URP Template.
This is a technical demo test, so it is not a 100% polished and the workflow has been followed keeping in mind that the first step is get it working and then, in the polishing step, I made the code more understandable and made the game look better.

## Workflow Diagram
For this test, it was required to create a workflow diagram showing the tasks that are requested in the PDF. The diagram can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16adVBFA2TAIyd_BKKFT4JV9KwQICydrs/view?usp=sharing).

## General tasks time estimation
- Unity Project and GitHub setup: **0:30h**
    - Did I completed the task as estimated? Yes. **Total time: 0:30**
    - Why? It was a very simple task, just creating a GitHub repository and creating the Unity project.

- Isometric Player movement and Input System: **3:30h**
    - Did I completed the task as estimated? It took less time than expected. **Total time: 1:30h**
    - Why? The project is a protoype so I'm not polishing it a lot. And also, setting up the isometric view in 2D was easier than I expected if I did it correctly.

- AI State Machine for Enemy Behavior: **6:00h**
    - Did I completed the task as estimated? I took me less then expected to get the state machine working with one of the bonus tasks done. I will come back to the left bonus tasks and see how much will it take for me to complete them. **Total time: 1:30h**
    - Why? I think I'm underestimating my knowledge, It's been a few weeks without me touching anything related to Unity and I feel that I know more than I thought.

- Basic Combat System: **7:00h**
    - Did I completed the task as estimated? Yes, again, it took me less than expected. **Total time: 3:23**
    - Why? If I'm being honest, I'm actually fast prototyping everything, I think it will all add up in time once I start polishing and debugging.

- Simple Inventory System: **5:00h**
    - Did I completed the task as estimated?
    - Why?
    
- Dialogue System with a custom Editor Tool: **11:00h**
    - Did I completed the task as estimated?
    - Why?
